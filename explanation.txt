Single-pass stream (line-by-line); group edges by (claim_id, status_code). Intern system names to ints. Per group: iterative DFS for longest simple cycle (self-loops = 1). Prune groups that can't beat current best. Ties: lexicographic key. Use --sorted (or pipe from sort) for one group at a time; --validate verifies sorted. I/O O(L); cycle detection O(G · 2^N) with N = max nodes per group.
